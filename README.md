**Node Javascript Challenge**

**Version 1.13.0**

**Professional e-commerce back end challenge activity.**

The aim of this project is to build a command-line application to manage a company's e-commerce database, using Node.js, and MySQL. Developers frequently have to create interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases.

This application allows employers to view and manage the departments such as products, categories, tags and product tags. This helps organize their websites and makes it more user friendly.

**This project follows the criteria below:**

- GIVEN a functional Express.js API
- WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- WHEN I enter schema and seed command then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
